# QuReP

Quick RESTful API in PHP, a domain-independent REST API Symfony bundle.

## What's this good for?

Imagine you want to develop a backend application with a RESTful interface.
Assuming you utilize Symfony3 and Doctrine for the task, the usual approach is to create
some Controller classes and implement actions in them. Why go through implementing the all the default POST, GET and
DELETE calls for every Entity, when someone has done it already?

QuReP helps you by providing CRUD operations for any Entity you'd like to
publish on your API, and does it quickly and out of the box.

For more information, see the [docs](doc/index.md) or the 
[reference implementation/test app](https://github.com/solazs/qurep-testing)!

### About this project
This project is still under heavy development, things are going to change.

Authorization of entities is on my TODO list, but it's not going to happen soon.
